# How to Use:
The following folder contains the code for an Example Support Portal Collibra Dashboard.

The Dashboard consists of 3 rows:

- Row 1: Top Row containing a searchbar and useful links to other content on the top right of the screen
- Row 2: Middle Row containing 3 Workflow Buttons which enable the end-user to create support tickets
- Row 3: Bottom Row containing information pertaining to each workflow in row 2

Rows 1 and 3 and achieved by embedding the HTML code in this folder as part of an Iframe (module or Reporting Insights)

Row 2 is achieved by using the Workflow Button widget and with some custom.css (also available)

# How to Edit:
The codeset has been commented to highlight areas where I'd reccommend editting/customisation.

# Design Style:
For Dashboards, a reactive design style is needed to ensure the embedded dashboard shares the Collibra look and feel and the experience is seamless. Inspiration taken from Collibra's own support portal and the new Data Marketplace.
