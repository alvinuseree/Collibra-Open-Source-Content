## Purpose

I've created this Repo to house some of the code I've created for other clients, colleagues and collibra data citizens. All of the code in this Repo can be reused/repurposed or other use cases.

Whilst I am happy to answer questions, I have no intention of actively supporting all of the code across Collibra versions - i.e. I can't promise the code you're interested in will work on the specific version of Collibra you're running!
